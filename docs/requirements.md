# Requirements Document

## Introduction

The current birds recognizer application uses MFCC (Mel-Frequency Cepstral Coefficients) features and a simple neural network for bird song classification. While functional, the model shows reliability issues that need to be addressed through improved feature extraction, enhanced model architecture, and better training strategies.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a bird enthusiast, I want the bird recognizer to accurately identify bird species from audio recordings, so that I can reliably learn about different birds in my environment.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a bird song is recorded or uploaded THEN the system SHALL achieve at least 85% accuracy on test data
2. WHEN multiple recordings of the same species are tested THEN the system SHALL provide consistent predictions with less than 10% variance
3. WHEN background noise is present THEN the system SHALL maintain at least 75% accuracy
4. WHEN the audio quality is poor THEN the system SHALL provide confidence scores to indicate prediction reliability

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a developer, I want to implement robust feature extraction methods, so that the model can better distinguish between different bird species.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN extracting features from audio THEN the system SHALL use multiple complementary feature types (MFCC, spectral, temporal)
2. WHEN processing audio frames THEN the system SHALL apply advanced preprocessing techniques including noise reduction
3. WHEN computing features THEN the system SHALL normalize features to improve model stability
4. WHEN handling variable-length audio THEN the system SHALL use consistent feature aggregation methods

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a machine learning practitioner, I want to implement an improved model architecture, so that the system can learn more complex patterns in bird songs.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN training the model THEN the system SHALL use a deeper architecture with appropriate regularization
2. WHEN processing sequential audio data THEN the system SHALL incorporate temporal modeling capabilities
3. WHEN training with limited data THEN the system SHALL use data augmentation techniques
4. WHEN evaluating model performance THEN the system SHALL implement proper cross-validation

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a user, I want the system to handle real-world audio conditions, so that it works reliably in various environments.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN audio contains multiple bird species THEN the system SHALL detect and classify the dominant species
2. WHEN audio has varying volume levels THEN the system SHALL normalize input appropriately
3. WHEN audio contains silence or non-bird sounds THEN the system SHALL provide appropriate confidence indicators
4. WHEN processing different audio formats THEN the system SHALL maintain consistent performance

### Requirement 5

**User Story:** As a developer, I want comprehensive model evaluation and monitoring, so that I can track and improve model performance over time.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN training completes THEN the system SHALL provide detailed performance metrics including precision, recall, and F1-score per class
2. WHEN making predictions THEN the system SHALL output confidence scores and alternative predictions
3. WHEN model performance degrades THEN the system SHALL provide diagnostic information
4. WHEN new training data is available THEN the system SHALL support incremental learning
