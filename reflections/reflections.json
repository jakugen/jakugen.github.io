What's bad about \r\n        logging empty string if client calls it with such parameter?\r\n    <\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n        In addition to hide the possible bug in logger's client, this code contains the bug by itself,\r\n        effectively preventing errors to be logged.\r\n    <\/p>\r\n    <p>\r\n        I think every line of code deserves at least little thought on why we need it in first place.\r\n    <\/p>\r\n<\/span>",
